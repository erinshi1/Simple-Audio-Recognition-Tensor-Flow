# Simple-Audio-Recognition-Tensor-Flow

This is for a machine learning course project, MSc Voice Technology 2023-2024 at RUG. Focuses on TensorFlow-based audio recognition. Starts with optimization of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model from TensorFlow's tutorial on simple audio recognition. Explores replacement of CNN with a convolutional autoencoder architecture for keyword recognition using spectrograms.
